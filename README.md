Applying Machine Learning Techniques to Housing Market Data
Objective

You are provided with a real-world housing dataset, updated_house_data.csv. Your task is to choose one machine learning approach from the four listed below and apply it thoughtfully to the dataset:

– Regression
– Classification
– Clustering
– Dimensionality Reduction

This assignment helps demonstrate your understanding of machine learning techniques in a practical and exploratory manner.
 Assignment Instructions

1. Explore the Dataset (EDA):

    – Begin with a basic exploration of the dataset.
    – Understand the structure, missing values, and feature types.
    – Visualize where necessary (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, etc.).

    2. Select One of the Following Tasks:

Option 1: Regression

Use machine learning to predict SalePrice using one selected feature.

– Choose any one numeric feature (e.g., LotArea, OverallQual, YearBuilt).
– Use SalePrice as your target.
– Apply at least one regression model (e.g., Linear Regression).
– Visualize the relationship between the selected feature and SalePrice.
Option 2: Classification

Predict the SalePrice Category using one selected feature.

– Use SalePrice Category as your target (Cheap, Average Price, Expensive).
– Choose any one feature as your predictor.
– Apply at least one classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree).
– Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, or F1 score.
Option 3: Clustering

Group similar houses using unsupervised learning.

– Choose at least two meaningful features (e.g., LotArea, GrLivArea, OverallQual).
– Apply KMeans or another clustering method.
– Visualize clusters using scatter plots.
– Interpret what the clusters mean.
Option 4: Dimensionality Reduction

Reduce the feature space and visualize patterns.

– Use multiple numerical features (minimum of 4).
– Apply PCA, t-SNE, or Isomap to reduce dimensions.
– Visualize results using scatter plots.
– Discuss patterns or separations you observe.
